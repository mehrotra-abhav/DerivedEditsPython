  Conda is a cross-platform, language-agnostic binary package manager. It is the package manager
  used by Anaconda installations, but it may be used for other systems as well. Conda makes
  environments first-class citizens, making it easy to create independent environments even for
  C libraries. Conda is written entirely in Python, and is BSD licensed open source.
